# Customer Behavioral Segmentation Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my project! This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of customer behavioral segmentation using advanced analytics techniques. Our objective is to understand user behavior, device loyalty, and purchasing patterns through detailed data analysis. By leveraging Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Apache Superset, this project delivers insights that empower data-driven decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11.1**: Core programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used for creating isolated development environments.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system used for storing and managing structured data.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- **Apache Superset**: Data visualization and dashboarding tool for displaying analytical results.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and working with large datasets.
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **seaborn**: A Python visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **plotly.graph_objects**: For visual analytics, complex plots and interactive dashboards.

## Project Structure

### Modular Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture to maintain organization and facilitate collaboration. Each component, from backend services to analytical models, is encapsulated within its own module, ensuring clear interfaces and dependencies.

- `/etl/`: Contains scripts for data ingestion, database management, and configuration settings.
  - **`.env`**: Manages sensitive information securely and customizes configurations.
  - **`requirement.txt`**: Lists all required Python packages.
  - **`Dockerfile`**: Sets up a Python application environment with necessary dependencies.
  - **`data_ingest.py`, `database.py`, `models.py`**: Handle database connections, model definitions, and data ingestion processes.

- `/analytics/`: Contains Jupyter Notebook files for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and segmentation.

- **`docker-compose.yaml`**: Orchestrates the development environment, including the PostgreSQL database, pgAdmin, and initialization scripts.

## Purpose and Goals

Our project aims to:

- **Deliver a Seamless User Experience**: Integrating backend technologies with interactive data analysis platforms.
- **Ensure Data Integrity and Scalability**: Implementing robust database models and efficient data management practices.
- **Drive Informed Decision-Making**: Using advanced analytics to extract actionable insights, supporting business strategies.
- **Customer Segmentation and Behavior Analysis**: Segmenting users based on purchasing patterns, device loyalty, and behavior.

## Methodology

### Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Insights

We analyzed historical data on device purchases, usage patterns, and brand loyalty to categorize users into distinct segments. This segmentation provides valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling targeted marketing and engagement strategies.

### Loyalty Analysis

Our analysis highlights user loyalty to specific brands, offering critical insights into repeat purchases and customer retention.

### Enhancing User Experience

By understanding distinct user segments, the project empowers businesses to enhance customer experience through personalized service offerings.

## Conclusion

In this project, we set out to address critical questions about user behavior, phone usage patterns, and purchasing tendencies. Through segmentation,and data-driven insights, we:

- **Segmented Customers Based on Behavior**: Identified distinct profiles to optimize marketing and customer engagement.
- **Derived Insights to Enhance Business Strategies**: Provided actionable insights to improve user engagement and optimize services.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of data analytics in understanding and influencing customer behavior. The methodologies and results presented provide a strong foundation for future exploration of user dynamics and continued refinement of segmentation.
